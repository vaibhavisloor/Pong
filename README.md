# Pong Game

This is a Python implementation of the classic game Pong, created using the Turtle module and following an object-oriented programming (OOP) approach. In this game, two players control paddles to hit a ball back and forth across the screen. The objective is to prevent the ball from passing your paddle while trying to score points by making the ball go past your opponent's paddle.

## Files

The game consists of the following files:

- `main.py`: The main script to run the game.
- `paddle.py`: Defines the `Paddle` class that represents the player-controlled paddles.
- `ball.py`: Contains the `Ball` class that represents the ball object in the game.
- `scoreboard.py`: Contains the `Scoreboard` class that manages and displays the game score.
